This is my index.html
It is where I will hook my React app into my application
I am hooking into the only <div> tag that is a child of my <body> tag
This is also where I allow my webpack bundled JS functionality to exist in my HTML/website and provide interaction with the client

This is the document declaration
This is where we tell the computer that the following is html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <!-- 
    This is where we set the metadata of the application
    This is me giving the tab on the page the name of 'Breathe Easy'
     -->
    <head>Breathe Easy</head>

    This is the body of the html document
    This is where html tags that will be displayed live as children
